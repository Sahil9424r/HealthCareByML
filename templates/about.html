                    <p class="lead">We aim to make preliminary medical diagnosis more accessible to everyone through the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
                    <p>Our Medical Diagnosis System utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and provide preliminary diagnosis information. By processing vast amounts of medical data, our system can identify patterns and correlations that might help users understand potential health conditions based on their symptoms.</p>
                    <p>While our system provides valuable information, it is important to note that it is not a replacement for professional medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Our system uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm trained on extensive medical datasets. When you input your symptoms, the algorithm analyzes them against known patterns of diseases and their symptoms.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">The process includes:</p>
